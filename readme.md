## Project Overview

The **Text Tokenization Using NLTK** project showcases different methods for breaking down text into smaller components such as sentences, words, and tokens. Tokenization is a fundamental step in text processing, often used in preparing data for further analysis in natural language processing (NLP) tasks.

## Project Structure

- **notebook.ipynb**: The Jupyter notebook containing the complete code for text tokenization using NLTK.
- **LICENSE**: The Apache License 2.0 file that governs the use and distribution of this project's code.
- **requirements.txt**: A file listing all the Python libraries and dependencies required to run the project.
- **.gitignore**: A file specifying which files or directories should be ignored by Git.

## Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository-name.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

``` bash
cd your-repository-name
```

3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

``` bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

```

4. Install the required dependencies:

``` bash 
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. Run the Jupyter notebook:

``` bash 
jupyter notebook notebook.ipynb
```

## Usage

Imports

The notebook begins by importing the necessary libraries for text tokenization:

```` bash

import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
from nltk.tokenize import sent_tokenize
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
from nltk.tokenize import wordpunct_tokenize
from nltk import TreebankWordTokenizer

````

These imports include methods for sentence tokenization (`sent_tokenize`), word tokenization (`word_tokenize`), and more specialized tokenization (`wordpunct_tokenize`, `TreebankWordTokenizer`).

## Text Tokenization
The notebook demonstrates several tokenization techniques using NLTK:

- Sentence Tokenization: Splitting a paragraph into individual sentences.

``` bash
sentences = sent_tokenize(paragraph)
```

- Word Tokenization: Breaking down a sentence or paragraph into individual words.
``` bash
words = word_tokenize(sentence)

```

- WordPunct Tokenization: Tokenizing text while also separating punctuation.

``` bash
tokens = wordpunct_tokenize(text)

```

- Treebank Word Tokenizer: A more sophisticated tokenizer that uses regular expressions.

``` bash
tokenizer = TreebankWordTokenizer()
tokens = tokenizer.tokenize(sentence)
``` 

These tokenization techniques are fundamental for text preprocessing, enabling more advanced NLP tasks such as part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, and sentiment analysis.
